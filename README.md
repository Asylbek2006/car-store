# Car Management System

## Project Overview
The Car Management System is a web-based application designed for managing vehicle listings and transactions. The system allows car sellers to list their vehicles, customers to browse and purchase cars, and administrators to manage users and listings. This project is built using the Go programming language with REST APIs and a monolithic architecture.

## Project Relevance
With the growing demand for online platforms, managing vehicle listings digitally has become essential. Current market solutions are either too complex or lack customization for smaller dealers. Our Car Management System aims to offer a simple, efficient, and scalable solution that focuses on backend design and real-world application.

## Target Users
The system is designed for three main user roles:
- Admin: Manages users, approves and monitors car listings.
- Seller: Adds, updates, and deletes car listings.
- Customer: Browses, searches, and requests car purchases.
